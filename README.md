# PHP 5.6 Docker Image
This is a fork of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`php`](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) which enables support for php 5.6 build with the newest upstream Docker templates and build scripts.

This can be used to run legacy code that can not be ported to php 7 easily.
Debian Buster and Alpine are available as base.
Be advised to better **not expose legacy php code to the internet**.

Use the [**automated builds from Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/joellinn/php).
